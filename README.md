# HIVD: A Framework for Efficient Image Categorisation in Social Research

## Overview

This repository contains the framework and methodologies developed in the doctoral dissertation **"A Framework for Efficient Image Categorisation in Social Research: Addressing High Intra-Class Visual Diversity"** by Vasileios Maltezos, University of Helsinki.

The framework addresses a fundamental challenge in computational social science: efficiently and accurately classifying images when items in the same theoretical category exhibit high visual diversity—a problem termed **High Intra-Class Visual Diversity (HIVD)**.

## The Challenge

In social and political research, images belonging to the same conceptual category often appear in widely varied visual forms. For example, political symbols, activist imagery, and memes can manifest in countless visual variations while maintaining the same theoretical meaning. Traditional computational methods struggle with this diversity, making automated categorisation difficult and inefficient.

## Key Methodological Innovations

### 1. **Class Solidification**
Creating explicit definitions for visual characteristics that qualify images for a particular category, making computational classification clearer and more consistent.

### 2. **Category Refinement and Subcategorisation**
Splitting broad theoretical constructs into visually coherent subgroups, reducing diversity within categories without losing theoretical richness.

### 3. **Bridging Qualitative and AI Methods**
Merging ethnographic approaches (where human interpretation is key) with artificial intelligence for improved, scalable analysis of visual data.

### 4. **Zero-Shot Classification with Strong Embeddings**
Using reference images to create strong embeddings for classification without requiring extensive pre-labeled training data, boosting both computational efficiency and accuracy.

## Empirical Applications

The framework has been validated through several case studies:

- **Hong Kong Protests**: Analysis of adaptations of the "Pepe the Frog" meme in Hong Kong's political protests
- **European Environmental Activism**: Mapping activist presence and political visibility on platforms like Instagram
- **Political Imagery Analysis**: Studying regimes of online political visibility across various social movements

## Use Cases

This framework is particularly valuable for:

- **Computational Social Scientists** analysing large-scale image datasets
- **Digital Humanities Researchers** working with visual social media data
- **Political Communication Scholars** studying online activism and political imagery
- **Data Scientists** dealing with high intra-class visual diversity in classification tasks

## Key Features

- Scalable methods for visual categorisation in social research
- Integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches
- Efficient handling of visually diverse image categories
- Practical solutions for limited training data scenarios
- Adaptable to various social research contexts
