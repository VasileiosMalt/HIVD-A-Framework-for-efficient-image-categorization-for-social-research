## Overview

This repository contains the methodological framework and computational approaches developed in the dissertation **"A Framework for Efficient Image Categorisation in Social Research: Addressing High Intra-Class Visual Diversity"** (University of Helsinki, 2026).

The framework attempts to address a fundamental challenge in computational social science: **how to accurately classify political imagery when images within the same theoretical category which exhibit substantially high visual diversity between each other and altogether** - a phenomenon identified as **High Intra-Class Visual Diversity (HIVD)**.

## The Challenge: High Intra-Class Visual Diversity

In political and social research, images that belong to the same conceptual category (e.g., "environmental activism", "protest imagery", "political memes") often display significant visual differences.

## Key Contributions

### Methodological Steps

1. **Class Solidification**: Forces explicit definition of visual characteristics that qualify images for specific categories
2. **Category Refinement**: Breaks broad theoretical constructs into visually coherent subgroups
3. **Subcategorization**: Addresses visual diversity while enriching theoretical understanding
4. **Object Detection Verification**: Post-classification system identifying potential misclassifications based on compositional rules
5. **Enhanced "Strong" Embedding-based Zero-Shot Classification**: Incorporates visual information from reference images to improve performance without extensive training datasets

### Research Applications

The framework has been successfully applied to:

- **Hong Kong Anti-Extradition Bill Movement**: Analysis of Pepe the Frog meme adaptations
- **European Environmental Activism**: Classification of activist imagery from Finland, France, Germany, and Portugal
- **Instagram Political Visibility**: Mapping regimes of online political visibility of activists
- **Cross-cultural Visual Activism**: Understanding how visual political participation varies across contexts

## Framework Architecture

```
Ethnographic Analysis → Visual Category Definition → Class Solidification
                                                            ↓
        Reference Image Selection ← Subcategorization ← Category Refinement
                    ↓
        Enhanced Zero-Shot Classification
                    ↓
        Object Detection Verification
                    ↓
            Final Classification
```

## Core Principles

1. **Ethnographic-Computational Dialogue**: Sustained interaction between computational methods and ethnographic understanding
2. **Visual-Theoretical Balance**: Computational requirements enhance theoretical clarity while ethnographic insights guide algorithmic development
3. **Contextual Sensitivity**: Maintains political and cultural context without sacrificing computational efficiency
4. **Scalability**: Applicable to large-scale visual datasets across diverse political contexts

## Research Context

### Dissertation Studies

## Use Cases

This framework is designed for researchers working on:

- Political communication and visual rhetoric
- Social movement analysis
- Meme culture and online activism
- Computational social science
- Digital ethnography
- Visual sociology and political science

## Technical Approach

### Classification Pipeline

- **Supervised Learning**: Custom trained models with ethnographically-informed categories
- **Zero-Shot Learning**: CLIP-based approaches enhanced with reference images
- **Object Detection**: YOLO-based verification systems
- **Hybrid Methods**: Combining multiple approaches for robust classification

### Key Advantages

✓ Handles high visual diversity within categories  
✓ Maintains interpretability and theoretical grounding  
✓ Computationally efficient for large datasets  
✓ Adaptable across political and cultural contexts  
✓ Combines quantitative rigor with qualitative depth
